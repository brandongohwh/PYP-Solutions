## Notes:
1. MH1401/2 was taught in MATLAB/C++ before AY1718 and therefore papers have been withheld.
2. Due to change in course structure, these are the renamed courses<br/>
a. MH1401 -> PS0001<br/>
b. MH1402 -> MH1403<br/>
c. MH2401 -> PS0002<br/><br/>

Note that all solutions here are the collaborative effort of seniors and every attempt has been made to ensure that the published solutions are correct.<br/>
